        <h2>Examining Peggy's Narcissistic Traits</h2>
        <p>Peggy Hill, the wife of Hank Hill in the TV series <i>‘King of the Hill’</i> is a narcissist. As a kid I couldn’t see the subtleties of her behaviour that were toxic, probably because I had a hard time understanding adults in any case. <i>‘King of the Hill’</i> in general came across as a dull show for a child viewer and I could really only appreciate the humour and the series as a whole as an adult.</p>
        <p>Anyway, before I digress, let’s talk about Peggy. She has an overly inflated ego, she genuinely believes to be a genius and a brilliant Spanish teacher, and she looks down on nearly everyone she comes across. Part of the charm of the series is the antics of Peggy Hill, a messed up and barely functioning mother with ridiculous expectations of her own grandeur.</p>
        <p>An example of Peggy’s unhealthy self-adoration is a conversation between Hank and Peggy in the episode where Peggy gets obsessed with proving her own genius:</p>
        <p><i>Peggy: What if I’m not really as smart as I think I am?!</i></p>
        <p><i>Hank: Aw c’mon Peggy, you’ve got an IQ of 170, you said so lots of times.</i></p>
        <p><i>Peggy: Yes but there could be a margin of error, especially when it’s just my own estimate.</i></p>
        <p>The whole episode is an absolute trainwreck for Peggy, one of my favourite lines was when Peggy finally breaks down and says to Hank, profusely crying:</p>
        <p>“Hank, I should’ve listened to you but I was humming inside my head while you were talking, waiting for you to stop.”</p>
        <p>The cherry on the cake is her belief that she can actually speak Spanish, as brilliantly displayed in the following video of Peggy

        in a Mexican court.</p>
        <p>She even calls her own spaghetti and meatballs “SpaPeggy and Meatballs” without giving any explanation to what makes them special and why they should be given any recognition.</p>
        <p>A narcissistic personality disorder is identified by these traits:</p>
            <li>Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others</li>
            <li>Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.</li>
            <li>Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions</li>
            <li>Needing constant admiration from others</li>
            <li>Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others</li>
            <li>Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain</li>
            <li>Unwilling to empathize with others’ feelings, wishes, or needs</li>
            <li>Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them</li>
            <li>Pompous and arrogant demeanor</li>
        <p>I’d say she checks most if not all of the traits, strongly suggesting that she is in fact clinically a narcissist.</p>
